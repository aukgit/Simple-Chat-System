##Simple Chat System in Java (CSE 338 Networking Course - North South University)

[Not complete yet, in the process of developing]

It's a simple chat system written in java. Completly written by Alim Ul Karim. All codes are modular. 

If you are looking for an open source java base chat client, look no further. You are in the right place. Take a look at my code.

###Instructions : How to make it ready on your environment. 


- Must use NetBeans 8.0.1 (at least, some time they change their core so try to have the same version as me). Back in 2011 , I designed a project with netbeans , now it doesn't work anymore because they have decided not to work with Swing framework.
- First you should create a database in mysql named 'chatdatabase' .
- You will find 'chatdatabase.sql' root of the project , download and execute that file inside your database.
- Connection string: should remain same and work just fine. You don't need to execute last option.
- Connection string(if needed to fix): Open "\src\Database\Components\ISoftwareInformation.java" , here replace the connection string with your database connection string. Easy way to get the connection string is to create a 'Master Form' with database using netbeans. Mail me if you are stuck.
